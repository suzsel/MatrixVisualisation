# Matrix Visualization Tools

This repository contains tools for visualizing matrix operations in both 2D and 3D. These Python scripts are designed for educational purposes, providing visualizations and calculations related to matrix transformations in various dimensions.

## Contents

- `linear_map.py` - A script for visualizing 2D matrix operations.
- `linear_map3d.py` - A script for visualizing 3D matrix operations.
- `/dist/linear_map.exe` - Compiled executable of the 2D visualization tool for Windows.
- `/dist/linear_map3d.exe` - Compiled executable of the 3D visualization tool for Windows.
